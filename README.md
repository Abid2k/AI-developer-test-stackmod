# ðŸŽ§ Audio Classification with CNN

## ðŸš€ Project Overview
This project is a deep learning-based **Audio Classification Model** that recognizes short audio commands using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**. The model classifies audio clips into six categories:
- `on`
- `off`
- `stop`
- `go`
